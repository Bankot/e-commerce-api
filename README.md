REMEMBER TO CHANGE CART SYSTEM IN FOLLOWING WAY:

- user is logged in -> create cart -> send cart and its changes to db
- no user is logged -> create cart -> send cart to session storage

BEFORE ORDER force unlogged user to create new account, and then send cart from local session to brand new user obj in db
