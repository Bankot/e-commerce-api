This is my first ts repo, and its really bad, but I like cart logic here, so im not gonna remove :_)




REMEMBER TO CHANGE CART SYSTEM IN FOLLOWING WAY:

- user is logged in -> create cart -> send cart and its changes to db
- no user is logged -> create cart -> send cart to session storage

BEFORE ORDER force unlogged user to create new account, and then send cart from local session to brand new user obj in db
